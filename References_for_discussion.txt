Gempt 2022: in a study og 56 GBM patients, 16% contained regions that were methy√∏ated and regions that were unmethylated. STP27 classifier. "This intratumoral heterogeneity is of utmost importance for molecular classification as well as for defining therapeutic targets in this disease, as single biopsies might underestimate the true molecular diversity in a tumor."

Jiminez 2022: 24 primary and secondary GBM pairs evaluated. median MGMT methylation declined from primary to secondary but changes observed in both directions. MGMT Pyro kit. Unmethylated (<9%), Intermediate (>9%, <29%), Hypermethylated (>29%). Only Hypermethylated show increased survival.

Tierling 2022: "Deep bisulfite sequencing" = 49 CpGs. Discrepancies between MGMT pyro kit and MSP in 27.5% of cases. "A hitherto neglected region upstream of the TSS, with an overall higher methylation compared to exon 1 and intron 1 of MGMT, is also able to discriminate the methylation status."

Brandner 2021: Huge meta-analysis. "Conclusions: ... our meta-analysis does not provide strong evidence about the best CpG sites or threshold. MSP has been studied mainly for CpG sites 76-80 and 84-87 and PSQ at CpG sites ranging from 72 to 95. A cutoff threshold of 9% for CpG sites 74-78 performed better than higher thresholds of 28% or 29% in 2 of the 3 good-quality studies."
